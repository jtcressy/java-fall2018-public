## Java Projects - Fall 2018

### Project 1: Kattis problems
- kattis/src/main/java/com/github/jtcressy/kattis/
	- addingwords
	- countingstars

### Project 2: Kattis problem(s) involving implementations of Java Collections Framework (JCF)
- kattis/src/main/java/com/github/jtcressy/kattis/
	- textprocessor
		- NOTE: This is an incomplete problem. It passes trivial tests but fails against time limit of < 1S because the solution is an O(N^2) operation. For test cases near the constraints of the problems, the elapsed time of the current algorithm is slightly over 1.0S and will not pass all tests on kattis as a result.

### Project 3: TBD

### Project 4: TBD

### Final Project: Android App To Control Companion Device
